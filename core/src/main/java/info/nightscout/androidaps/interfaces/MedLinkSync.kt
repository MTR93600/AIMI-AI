/**
 * This interface allows pump drivers to push data changes (creation and update of treatments, temporary basals and extended boluses) back to AAPS-core.
 *
 * Intended use cases for handling bolus treatments:
 *
 *  - for pumps that have a reliable history that can be read and which therefore issue a bolus on the pump,
 *    read the history back and add new bolus entries on the pump, the method [syncBolusWithPumpId]
 *    are used to inform AAPS-core of a new bolus.
 *    [info.nightscout.androidaps.danars.DanaRSPlugin] is a pump driver that
 *    takes this approach.
 *  - for pumps that don't support history or take rather long to complete a bolus, the methods
 *    [addBolusWithTempId] and [syncBolusWithTempId] provide a mechanism to notify AAPS-core of a started
 *    bolus, so AAPS-core can operate under the assumption the bolus will be delivered and effect IOB until delivery
 *    completed. Upon completion, the pump driver will call the second method to turn a temporary bolus into a finished
 *    bolus.
