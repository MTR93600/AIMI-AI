    <string name="description_sensitivity_aaps">Sensitivity is calculated the same way like Oref0, but you can specify timeframe to the past. Minimal carb absorption is calculated from max carb absorption time from preferences.</string>
    <string name="description_sensitivity_oref1">Sensitivity is calculated from 8h or 24h data in the past (using either which is more sensitive). Carbs (if not absorbed) are cut after time specified in preferences. Plugin also calculates UAM.</string>
    <string name="description_sensitivity_weighted_average">Sensitivity is calculated as a weighted average from deviations. Newer deviations have higher weight. Minimal carb absorption is calculated from max carb absorption time from preferences. This algorithm is the fastest in following sensitivity changes.</string>
    <string name="uam_disabled_oref1_not_selected">UAM disabled because it rely on Oref1 sensitivity plugin</string>

    <string name="openapsama_autosens_max_summary">Default value: 1.2\nThis is a multiplier cap for autosens (and soon autotune) to set a 20%% max limit on how high the autosens ratio can be, which in turn determines how high autosens can adjust basals, how low it can adjust ISF, and how low it can set the BG target.</string>

The default is an expected 3mg/dl/5min. This affects how fast COB are decayed, and how much carb absorption is assumed in calculating future predicted BG, when BG is falling more than expected, or not rising as much as expected.</string>
