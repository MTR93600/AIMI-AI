/**
 * Class for reporting progress updates.
 *
 * "Progress" is defined here as a planned sequence of [ProgressStage] instances.
 * These stages describe information about the current progress. Stage instances
 * can contain varying information, such as the index of the factor that is
 * currently being set in a basal profile, or the IUs of a bolus that were
 * administered so far.
 *
 * A sequence always begins with [BasicProgressStage.Idle] and ends with either
 * [BasicProgressStage.Finished] or a subclass of [BasicProgressStage.Aborted]. These are
 * special in that they are never explicitly specified in the sequence. [BasicProgressStage.Idle]
 * is always set as the current flow value when the reporter is created and when
 * [reset] is called. The other two are passed to [setCurrentProgressStage], which
 * then immediately forwards them in a [ProgressReport] instance, with that instance's
 * stage number set to [numStages] (since both of these stages define the end of a sequence).
 *
 * In code that reports progress, the [setCurrentProgressStage] function is called
 * to deliver updates to the reporter, which then forwards that update to subscribers
 * of the [progressFlow]. The reporter takes care of checking where in the sequence
 * that stage is. Stages are indexed by stage numbers, which start at 0. The size
 * of the sequence equals [numStages].
 *
 * Updates to the flow are communicated as [ProgressReport] instances. They provide
 * subscribers with the necessary information to show details about the current
 * stage and to compute a progress percentage (useful for GUI progress bar elements).
 *
 * Example of how to use this class:
 *
 * First, the reporter is instantiated, like this:
 *
 * ```
 * val reporter = ProgressReporter(listOf(
 *     BasicProgressStage.StartingConnectionSetup::class,
 *     BasicProgressStage.EstablishingBtConnection::class,
 *     BasicProgressStage.PerformingConnectionHandshake::class
 * ))
 * ```
 *
 * Code can then report an update like this:
 *
 * ```
 * reporter.setCurrentProgressStage(BasicProgressStage.EstablishingBtConnection(1, 4))
 * ```
 *
 * This will cause the reporter to publish a [ProgressReport] instance through its
 * [progressFlow], looking like this:
 *
 * ```
 * ProgressReport(stageNumber = 1, numStages = 3, stage = BasicProgressStage.EstablishingBtConnection(1, 4))
 * ```
 *
 * This allows code to report progress without having to know what its current
 * stage number is (so it does not have to concern itself about providing a correct
 * progress percentage). Also, that way, code that reports progress can be combined.
 * For example, if function A contains setCurrentProgressStage calls, then the
 * function that called A can continue to report progress. And, the setCurrentProgressStage
 * calls from A can also be used to report progress in an entirely different function.
 * One actual example is the progress reported when a Bluetooth connection is being
 * established. This is used both during pairing and when setting up a regular
 * connection, without having to write separate progress report code for both.
 *
 * @param plannedSequence The planned progress sequence, as a list of ProgressStage
 *        classes. This never contains [BasicProgressStage.Idle],
 *        [BasicProgressStage.Finished], or a [BasicProgressStage.Aborted] subclass.
 * @param context User defined contxt to pass to computeOverallProgressCallback.
 *        This can be updated via [reset] calls.
 * @param computeOverallProgressCallback Callback for computing an overall progress
 *        indication out of the current stage. Valid range for the return value
 *        is 0.0 to 1.0. See [ProgressReport] for an explanation of the arguments.
 *        Default callback calculates (stageNumber / numStages) and uses the result.
