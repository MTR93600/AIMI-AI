/**
 * Class containing the 24 basal profile factors.
 *
 * The factors are stored as integer-encoded-decimals. The
 * last 3 digits of the integers make up the fractional portion.
 * For example, integer factor 4100 actually means 4.1 IU.
 *
 * The Combo uses the following granularity:
 *   0.00 IU to 0.05 IU  : increment in 0.05 IU steps
 *   0.05 IU to 1.00 IU  : increment in 0.01 IU steps
 *   1.00 IU to 10.00 IU : increment in 0.05 IU steps
 *   10.00 IU and above  : increment in 0.10 IU steps
 *
 * The [sourceFactors] argument must contain exactly 24
 * integer-encoded-decimals. Any other amount will result
 * in an [IllegalArgumentException]. Furthermore, all
 * factors must be >= 0.
 *
 * [sourceFactors] is not taken as a reference. Instead,
 * its 24 factors are copied into an internal list that
 * is accessible via the [factors] property. If the factors
 * from [sourceFactors] do not match the granularity mentioned
 * above, they will be rounded before they are copied into
 * the [factors] property. It is therefore advisable to
 * look at that property after creating an instance of
 * this class to see what the profile's factors that the
 * Combo is using actually are like.
 *
 * @param sourceFactors The source for the basal profile's factors.
 * @throws IllegalArgumentException if [sourceFactors] does not
 *   contain exactly 24 factors or if at least one of these
 *   factors is negative.
