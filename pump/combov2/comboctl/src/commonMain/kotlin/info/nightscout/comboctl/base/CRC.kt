 * Computes the CRC-16-MCRF4XX checksum out of the given data.

 * simply pass the previously computed checksum as currentChecksum
 * argument to get an updated checksum. Otherwise, just using the
 * default value 0xFFFF (the "initial seed") is enough.
 *
 * @param data Data to compute the checksum out of.
 * @param currentChecksum Current checksum, or 0xFFFF as initial seed.
 * @return The computed checksum.
