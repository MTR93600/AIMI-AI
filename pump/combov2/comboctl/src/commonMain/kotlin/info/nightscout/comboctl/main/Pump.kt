/**
 * Main pump control class.
 *
 * This is the class that callers will mainly use for interacting with a pump.
 * It takes care of IO with the pump and implements higher level commands like
 * setting / getting the basal profile, delivering a bolus, getting / setting
 * TBRs and the current datetime etc.
 *
 * To begin operating the pump, call [connect] to set up a Bluetooth connection.
 * The connection can be terminated with [disconnect].
 *
 * This class applies a series of checks for safety and robustness reasons.
 * These are divided into checks performed by [connect] and checks performed
 * before, during, and after command execution. See [connect] for a documentation
 * about the on-connect checks. As for the command execution ones, these are:
 *
 * 1. Before each command, the Combo's warning & error flags are queried.
 *   If these are set, the Combo is switched to the remote terminal mode
 *   to "see" what warning/error is on the RT screen. That screen is parsed
 *   and processed. If it can't be handled locally, an [AlertScreenException]
 *   is thrown.
 * 2. During command execution, if the execution fails due to connection issues,
 *   and the command is idempotent, this class attempts to reconnect to the pump,
 *   followed by another command execution attempt. This is repeated a number of
 *   times until execution succeeds or all possible attempts have been exhausted.
 *   If no attempt succeeded, [CommandExecutionAttemptsFailedException] is thrown.
 *   However, if the command is _not_ idempotent ([deliverBolus] is a notable
 *   example), then no repeat attempts are made. A command is idempotent if
 *   a command can be repeated safely. This is the case when repeated execution
 *   doesn't actually change anything unless the previous attempt failed.
 *   For example, if the same TBR is (re)started twice in quick succession,
 *   the second attempt effectively changes nothing. Repeating the same bolus
 *   however is _not_ idempotent since these boluses stack up, so failed bolus
 *   deliveries *must not* be repeated.
 * 3. After command execution, the same check from step #1 is performed.
 *
 * All datetime timestamps are given as [Instant] values instead of localtime.
 * This is done to ensure that timezone and/or daylight savings changes do
 * not negatively affect operation of the pump. The pump's current datetime
 * is automatically adjusted if it deviates from the current system datetime,
 * and the system's current UTC offset is also stored (in the [PumpStateStore]).
 *
 * This class also informs callers about various events of type [Event].
 * Events can be for example "battery low", "TBR started", "bolus delivered" etc.
 * When the Combo is suspended, a 0% 15-minute TBR event is emitted, since the
 * suspended state effectively acts like such a 0% TBR. Events are emitted via
 * the [onEvent] callback. Errors are communicated as exceptions, not as events.
 *
 * The class has a state (via [stateFlow]) and a status ([statusFlow]). The
 * state informs about what the pump is currently doing or what it can
 * currently do, while the status informs about various quantities in the
 * pump, like how many IUs the pump's reservoir currently has. The status
 * is updated by calling [updateStatus]. Note however that some functions
 * like [connect] also automatically update the status.
 *
 * [initialBasalProfile] allows for setting a known basal profile as the
 * current one. This does _not_ program that profile into the pump; instead,
 * this sets the initial value of [currentBasalProfile]. If that property
 * is null, [connect] will read the profile from the pump, so if the user
 * is certain that the pump already contains a certain profile, setting
 * this argument to that profile avoids an unnecessary basal profile read
 * operation when connecting.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: The commands in this class are not designed to be executed
 * concurrently (the Combo does not support this), so make sure these
 * commands (for example, [setBasalProfile] and [deliverBolus]) are
 * never called concurrently by multiple threads and/or coroutines.
 * If necessary, use synchronization primitives.
 *
 * @param bluetoothDevice [BluetoothDevice] object to use for
 *   Bluetooth I/O. Must be in a disconnected state when
 *   assigned to this instance.
 * @param pumpStateStore Pump state store to use.
 * @param initialBasalProfile Basal profile to use as the initial value
 *   of [currentBasalProfile].
 * @param onEvent Callback to inform caller about events that happen
 *   during a connection, like when the battery is going low, or when
 *   a TBR started.

     * cancellation rolls back any partial connection setup that
     * might have been done by the time the cancellation occurs.
     *
     * At each connection setup, a series of checks are performed.:
     *
     * 1. [updateStatus] is called to get the current up-to-date status,
     * which is needed by other checks. This also updates the [statusFlow].
     * 2. The command mode history delta is retrieved. This contains all
     * delivered boluses since the last time the history delta was retrieved.
     * If no boluses happened in between connections, this list will be empty.
     * Otherwise, unaccounted boluses happened. These are announced via [onEvent].
     * 3. The current pump status is evaluated. If the pump is found to be
     * suspended, the [stateFlow] switches to [State.Suspended], the checks
     * end, and so does this function. Otherwise, it continues.
     * 4. The TBR state is evaluated according to the information from
     * [PumpStateStore] and what is displayed on the main Combo screen
     * (this is retrieved by [updateStatus] in the remote terminal mode).
     * If an unknown TBR is detected, then that unknown TBR is cancelled,
     * and [Event.UnknownTbrDetected] is emitted via [onEvent].
     * 5. If [currentBasalProfile] is null, or if the current basal rate
     * that is shown on the main Combo RT screen does not match the current
     * basal rate from the profile at this hour, the basal profile is read
     * from the Combo, and [currentBasalProfile] is updated. The basal
     * profile retrieval can be tracked via [getBasalProfileFlow].
     * 6. The current pump's datetime is updated to match the current
     * system datetime if there is a mismatch. This is done through the
     * remote terminal mode. The progress can be tracked by watching the
     * [setDateTimeProgressFlow].
     * 7. The current pump's UTC offset is updated to match the current
     * system's UTC offset if there is a mismatch. The UTC offset is
     * written to [pumpStateStore].
     *
     * Since no two clients can deliver a bolus, set a TBR etc. on the same
     * Combo simultaneously, these checks do not have to be performed before
     * each command - it is sufficient to do them upon connection setup.
     *
     * If IO errors happen during a connection attempt, this function tries
     * to establish the connection again. The maximum number of attempts is
     * specified by the [maxNumAttempts] argument. It can be set to null to
     * allow for an unlimited amount of attempts. This should only be used
     * if the caller has some sort of custom timeout mechanism at which the
     * [disconnect] function is called (which makes this function abort).
     *
     * This function also handles a special situation if the [Nonce] that is
     * stored in [PumpStateStore] for this pump is incorrect. The Bluetooth
     * socket can then be successfully connected, but right afterwards, when
     * this function tries to send a [TransportLayer.Command.REQUEST_REGULAR_CONNECTION]
     * packet, the Combo does not respond, instead terminating the connection
     * and producing a [BluetoothException]. If this happens, this function
     * increments the nonce and tries again. This is done multiple times
     * until either the connection setup succeeds or the maximum number of
     * attempts is reached. In the latter case, this function throws a
     * [ConnectionRequestIsNotBeingAcceptedException]. The user should then
     * be recommended to re-pair with the Combo, since establishing a connection
     * isn't working.

     * Instructs the pump to deliver a bolus.
     *
     * The function suspends until the immediate portion of the bolus was fully delivered,
     * or when an error occurred. In the latter case, an exception is thrown.
     *
     * The bolus delivey is split in two parts: the immediate portion and the extended
     * portion. The immediate portion is infused right away, as fast as the Combo is able
     * to do so. The extended portion is delivered over the specified [durationInMinutes],
     * and behaves much like a TBR.
     *
     * During the delivery of the immediate portion, the current status is periodically
     * retrieved from the pump. [bolusStatusUpdateIntervalInMs] controls the status update
     * interval. At each update, the bolus state is checked (that is, whether it is delivering,
     * or whethr it is done, or an error occurred etc.) The bolus amount that was delivered
     * by that point is communicated via the [bolusDeliveryProgressFlow].
     *
     * To cancel the immediate delivery of the bolus, simply cancel the coroutine that is
     * suspended by this function.
     *
     * IMPORTANT: The extended portion _cannot_ be canceled that way; there is no way of
     * doing that other than for the Combo to be stopped and started again.
     *
     * Prior to the delivery, the number of units available in the reservoir is checked
     * by looking at [statusFlow] and compared against [totalBolusAmount]. If there aren't
     * enough IU in the reservoir, this function throws [InsufficientInsulinAvailableException].
     *
     * After the delivery, this function looks at the Combo's bolus history delta. That
     * delta is expected to contain exactly one entry - the bolus that was just delivered
     * or started (depending on the bolus type). The details in that history delta entry
     * are then emitted via [onEvent] as [Event.StandardBolusInfused] for a standard bolus.
     * Extended boluses generate [Event.ExtendedBolusStarted]. Likewise, multiwave boluses
     * generate [Event.MultiwaveBolusStarted].
     *
     * If there is no entry, [BolusNotDeliveredException] is thrown. If a standard bolus
     * was delivered, and more than one bolus entry is detected, [UnaccountedBolusDetectedException]
     * is thrown. The history delta is looked at even if an exception is thrown (unless
     * it is one of the exceptions that were just mentioned). This is because if there is
     * an error _during_ an immediate delivery, then some insulin might have still been
     * delivered, and there will be a corresponding history entry, probably just not with
     * the insulin amount that was originally planned. It is still important to report
     * that (partial) delivery, which is done with [onEvent] just as described above.
     *
     * Once that is completed, this function calls [updateStatus] to make sure the contents
     * of [statusFlow] are up-to-date. A bolus delivery will at least change the value of
     * [Status.availableUnitsInReservoir] (unless perhaps it is a very small bolus like
     * 0.1 IU, since the reservoir level is given inwhole IU units).
     *
     * @param totalBolusAmount Total bolus amount to deliver (that is, the sum of the immediate
     * and extended portions). Note that this is given in 0.1 IU units, so for example,
     *   "57" means 5.7 IU. Valid range is 0.0 IU to 25.0 IU (that is, integer values 0-250).
     * @param immediateBolusAmount The amount to deliver immediately. This is only used
     *   [bolusType] is [CMDDeliverBolusType.MULTIWAVE_BOLUS], and is ignored otherwise.
     *   When delivering a multiwave bolus, this value must be >= 1 and < [totalBolusAmount].
     * @param durationInMinutes The duration of the extended bolus or the extended portion
     *   of the multiwave bolus. If [bolusType] is set to [CMDDeliverBolusType.STANDARD_BOLUS],
     *   this value is ignored. Otherwise, it must be at least 15. Maximum possible value
     *   is 720 (= 12 hours).
     * @param standardBolusReason Reason for the standard bolus. If [bolusType] is not
     *   [CMDDeliverBolusType.STANDARD_BOLUS], this value is ignored.
     * @param bolusType Type of the bolus.
     * @param bolusStatusUpdateIntervalInMs Interval between status updates,
     *   in milliseconds. Must be at least 1.
     * @throws BolusNotDeliveredException if the pump did not deliver the bolus.
     *   This typically happens because the pump is currently stopped.
     * @throws BolusCancelledByUserException when the bolus was cancelled by the user.
     * @throws BolusAbortedDueToErrorException when the bolus delivery failed due
     *   to an error.
     * @throws UnaccountedBolusDetectedException if after the bolus delivery
     *   more than one bolus is reported in the Combo's bolus history delta.
     * @throws InsufficientInsulinAvailableException if the reservoir does not
     *   have enough IUs left for this bolus.
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if [totalBolusAmount] is not in the 0-250 range, or
     *   if [bolusStatusUpdateIntervalInMs] is less than 1, or if [immediateBolusAmount] exceeds
     *   [totalBolusAmount] when delivering a multiwave bolus, or if [durationInMinutes] is <15
     *   when [bolusType] is set to anything other than [CMDDeliverBolusType.STANDARD_BOLUS].
     * @throws IllegalStateException if the current state is not
     *   [State.ReadyForCommands].
