/**
 * State store interface for a specific pump.
 *
 * This interface provides access to a store that persistently
 * records the data of [InvariantPumpData] instances along with
 * the current Tx nonce, UTC offset, and TBR state.
 *
 * As the name suggests, these states are recorded persistently,
 * immediately, and ideally also atomically. If atomic storage cannot
 * be guaranteed, then there must be some sort of data error detection
 * in place to ensure that no corrupted data is retrieved. (For example,
 * if the device running ComboCtl crashes or freezes while the data is
 * being written into the store, the data may not be written completely.)
 *
 * There is one state for each paired pump. Each instance contains the
 * [InvariantPumpData], which does not change after the pump was paired,
 * the Tx nonce, which does change after each packet that is sent to
 * the Combo, the UTC offset, which usually does not change often, and
 * the TBR state, which changes whenever a TBR starts/ends. These parts
 * of a pump's state are kept separate due to the difference in access
 * patterns (that is, how often they are updated), since this allows for
 * optimizations in implementations.
 *
 * Each state is associate with a pump via the pump's Bluetooth address.
 *
 * If a function or property access throws [PumpStateStoreAccessException],
 * then the state is to be considered invalid, any existing connections
 * to a pump associated with the state must be terminated, and the pump must
 * be unpaired. This is because such an exception indicates an error in
 * the underlying pump state store implementation that said implementation
 * could not recover from. And this also implies that this pump's state inside
 * the store is in an undefined state - it cannot be relied upon anymore.
 * Internally, the implementation must delete any remaining state data when
 * such an error occurs. Callers must then also unpair the pump at the Bluetooth
 * level. The user must be told about this error, and instructed that the pump
 * must be paired again.
 *
 * Different pump states can be accessed, created, deleted concurrently.
 * However, operations on the same state must not happen concurrently.
 * For example, it is valid to create a pump state while an existing [PumpIO]
 * instance updates the Tx nonce of its associated state, but no two threads
 * may update the Tx nonce at the same time, or try to access state data and
 * delete the same state simultaneously, or access a pump state's Tx nonce
 * while another thread writes a new UTC offset into the same pump state.
 *
 * The UTC offset that is stored for each pump here exists because the Combo
 * is unaware of timezones or UTC offsets. All the time data it stores is
 * in localtime. The UTC offset in this store specifies what UTC offset
 * to associate any current Combo localtime timestamp with. Particularly
 * for the bolus history this is very important, since it allows for properly
 * handling daylight savings changes and timezone changes (for example because
 * the user is on vacation in another timezone). The stored UTC offset is
 * also necessary to be able to detect UTC offset changes even if they
 * happen when the client is not running. The overall rule with regard
 * to UTC offset changes and stored Combo localtime timestamps is that
 * all currently stored timestamps use the currently stored UTC offset,
 * and any timestamps that might be stored later on will use the new
 * UTC offset. In practice, this means that all timestamps from the Combo's
 * command mode history delta use the current UTC offset, and after the
 * delta was fetched, the UTC offset is updated.
 *
 * Finally, the stored TBR state exists because of limitations in the Combo
 * regarding ongoing TBR information. See [CurrentTbrState] for details.
