/**
 * Special pump state store that mainly uses the internalSP, but also is able to sync up the AAPS main SP with that internal SP.
 *
 * This pump state store solves a problem: What if the user already paired AAPS with a Combo, and then imports and old AAPS
 * settings file, intending to just restore other settings like the basal profile, but does _not_ intend to import an old
 * pump state? After all, if we write a pump state to the AAPS main SP, the state values will also be written into a settings
 * file when exporting said settings. If we just relied on the main AAPS SP, the current pump state - including pairing info
 * like the PC and CP keys - would be overwritten with the old ones from the imported settings, and the user would have to
 * unnecessarily re-pair the Combo every time settings get imported.
 *
 * The solution is for this driver to _not_ primarily use the AAPS main SP. Instead, it uses its own internal SP. That SP
 * is exclusively used by this driver. But, a copy of the pump state values are stored in the AAPS main SP, and kept in
 * sync with the contents of the internal SP.
 *
 * When a new pump state is created, the invariant values (CP/PC keys etc.) are written in both the AAPS main SP and the
 * internal SP, along with the initial nonce. During operation, the driver will update the nonce value of the internal SP.
 * If TBR states are changed, then these changes are stored in the internal SP. Callers can use [copyVariantValuesToAAPSMainSP]
 * to update the corresponding values in the AAPS main SP to keep the two SPs in sync.
 *
 * There are a couple of special situations:
 *
 * 1. There is no pump state in the internal SP, and there is no pump state in the AAPS main SP. This is the unpaired state.
 * 2. There is no pump state in the internal SP, but there is one in the AAPS main SP. This typically happens when the
 *   user (re)installed AAPS, and immediately after installing, imported AAPS settings. Callers are then supposed to call
 *   [copyAllValuesFromAAPSMainSP] to import the pump state from the AAPS main SP over to the internal SP and continue to
 *   work with that state.
 * 3. There is a pump state, and there is also one in the AAPS main SP. The latter one is then ignored. A pump state in the
 *   AAPS main SP solely and only exists to be able to export/import pump states. It is not used for actual pump operations.
 *   In particular, if - as mentioned above - a pump is already paired, and the user imports settings, this logic prevents
 *   the current pump state to be overwritten.
